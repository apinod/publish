                        <b>George Reyes, President, CEO and Founder</b>, is an accomplished entrepreneur with a long track record of success beginning when he was 19 years old. He built and sold his first business for more than $1M by the age of 21.  After selling this business, George moved from California to Florida and became a real estate entrepreneur, eventually building well over $100M worth of "trophy" homes in South Florida and created several successful ancillary businesses during this period.
                        For nearly 10 years, George was associated with an Invoice, Payment and Credit business.  He was responsible for bringing in over 90% of the revenue for that business while also serving on the board.  When he left in early 2013, it was processing over $1 billion in transactions each year.
                        George has listened to and spoken with hundreds of customers.  Based on that feedback and his expertise, he has built a system that addresses each company’s receivable, payable and cash flow issues.  In one consolidated system, he has built a one of kind business and technological solution.
                        George is a broad gauge businessman with the ability to think strategically and execute tactically.  He has a history of building strong partnerships, relationships and teams.  George is a graduate of California State University at Long Beach.

The firm's clients included Boston Scientific (18 years), Johnson & Johnson and many early stage companies.  For Boston Scientific, Steve and his team developed and executed the strategy for the launch of well over 100 products in interventional medicine in the fields of radiology, cardiology, neurology, urology and endoscopy.

                        In recent years, Steve has worked extensively with early stage companies developing their strategies for raising capital and commercialization.  He performed due diligence for Mr. Reyes on the investment in the payment solutions company.  In the process, he became intimately familiar with the inner workings of electronically invoicing, payments and credit.  Steve also served on the board of the payment solutions company as well as an advisor on operations.

                        Over his career, Steve has interacted with many financial institutions ranging from commercial banks to investment banks to factors.

                        Steve has been active in the community, serving on various non-profit boards, including two where he has been a long term, unpaid Treasurer.  He is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania.
